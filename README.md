## Using every element
### Why?  

For learning purposes, I'm making a pure HTML website containing all HTML elements in existence (hopefully organized enough). I'm not alone â€” (W3C)[https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110405/Overview.html] specs, and other similar resources, should help me along the way.

### Why is there that there is a `styles` directory and a `scripts` directory present?  

This is primarily for practice reasons. However, I might add *some* CSS if it becomes necessary later on the project.
