## GPT-3 gives us some interesting fillers:

`<h1>`: The most important header on the page, typically used for the main title or headline. Descriptive words could include "primary," "prominent," "bold," or "dominant."
Example: `<h1>`Breaking News: Earthquake Strikes Capital City`</h1>`

`<h2>`: A secondary header that provides more detail or supports the main header. Descriptive words could include "supporting," "subordinate," "secondary," or "underlying."
Example: `<h2`>`Mayor Declares State of Emergency After Quake Hits Downtown`</h2>`

`<h3>`: A subheader that provides additional detail or context to the previous headers. Descriptive words could include "tertiary," "minor," "subordinate," or "supporting."
Example: `<h3>`City Officials Advise Residents to Stay Home and Avoid Downtown Area`</h3>`

`<h4>`: A smaller subheader that provides further detail or clarification. Descriptive words could include "small," "precise," "specific," or "detailed."
Example: `<h4>`Power Outages Reported Across City Following Earthquake`</h4>`

`<h5>`: A smaller header used for minor details or subcategories. Descriptive words could include "minor," "subtle," "nuanced," or "specific."
Example: `<h5>`Business Owners Urged to Check Buildings for Damage Before Reopening`</h5>`

`<h6>`: The smallest header size, typically used for footnotes or other small details. Descriptive words could include "small," "fine print," "discrete," or "minor."
Example: `<h6>`*Source: US Geological Survey`</h6>`

## More GPT-3 Wisdom -- it **is** correct, though
The HTML `<p>` element is a block-level element, meaning that it creates a rectangular block on the page that takes up the full width of its parent container and creates a new line before and after the element. This is in contrast to inline elements, which do not create new lines and only take up as much width as necessary to display their content.

When you use the `<p>` element to create a paragraph of text, the text will be displayed as a block on the page with space above and below it. You can also apply CSS styles to the `<p>` element to control its appearance, such as setting its font size, color, or background color.
