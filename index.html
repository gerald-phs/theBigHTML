		<h3>Initial Considerations</h3>
		<p class="typography">Lexicographers have to keep updating the dictionary to accomodate new slang, subcultural idioms, and different expressions, in order to maintain a categorical and trustworthy order, like a building, lest it falls apart due to its axiomatic structures being under duress. Otherwise, "Official Communication Letter to The United States Coast Guard" and "Fried Bananas Are Crazy My Name's Philip" may start to mean the same thing. In mathematics, there are axioms. In philosophy, there are axioms. In programming, there are also axioms. Therefore, in HTML, the <em>language of the web</em>, it should be no different. Rules, specifications, and standards exist. We should not be scared, but rather stand in awe of the marvelous abstract structural monument that was built, is being fixed daily, and is trusted by millions to keep working indefinitely (uptime-wise and future-wise). And it is freely available for our consultation. Therefore, if we are to call ourselves HTML professionals, there is categorically no other option than to peruse the sacred tomes...</p> 
		<p class="typography">Below, you will find brief descriptions of these remarkable institutions that I have collected from around the Web.</p>
		
		<q class="cit">The <b><abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr></b> is the main international standards organization for the World Wide Web. Founded in 1994 and led by Tim Berners-Lee, the consortium is made up of member organizations that maintain full-time staff working together in the development of standards for the World Wide Web. As of 21 March 2022, W3C had 459 members. W3C also engages in education and outreach, develops software and serves as an open forum for discussion about the Web.</q>

	<section id="ELEMENTS_ALPHABETICAL">
		<!-- comment -->
		<span class="comment-green">&lt;!-- This is a comment. We know what a comment is. It documents code, but affects it not. --&gt;</span><br><br>
		
		<!-- doctype declaration -->
		<p class="typography">The <span class="code-green">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span> declaration. It has to be present on the very start of all HTML documents. No questions asked. This isn't the content of a <span class="code-green">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span> element <i>per se</i>. However, now that I think of it, <b>this entire page could be considered the contents of that one single element (or perhaps <span class="code-green">&lt;html&gt;</span>)</b>. This content, at the innermost level, is just wrapped around <span class="code-green">&lt;p&gt;</span> tags.</p>
		
		<!-- <a>  -->
		<p class="typography">The <span class="code-green">&lt;a&gt;</span> element is for placing links in a page, and it stands for <span class="orange-shadow">anchor</span>. It has all sorts of different attributes and interesting features. I am not wrapping all this content in <span class="code-green">&lt;a&gt;</span> tags, for it would look very silly. Here's what it looks like <a href="https://www.google.com">by default</a>.</p>

		<!-- <abbr> -->
		<p class="typography">The acronym in the next sentence is wrapped in <span class="code-green">&lt;abbr&gt;</span> tags: The National Health Service (<abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>), is the publicly funded healthcare system in England...</p>

		<!-- <area> -->
		<span>The <span class="code-green">&lt;area&gt;</span> element. Image maps and clickable areas.</span>
		
		<article>This is the content of an <span class="code-green">&lt;article&gt;</span> element. Besides its semantic function (which is to inform us about the nature of its contents), it's also used to represent a section in a webpage that stands on its own two feet, and, in my own words, could be safely extracted from the webpage and the latter would not lose its essential conveyance meaning.</article><br>
		
		<aside>This is the content of an <span class="code-green">&lt;aside&gt;</span> element. Besides its semantic function (which is to inform us about the nature of its contents), it's also used to represent a section in a webpage that stands aside from the document's main content, like a sidebar for example.</aside>

		<!-- <audio> -->
			These are <span class="code-green">&lt;audio&gt;</span> elements.

			<!-- <b> -->
		<b>This is the content of a <span class="code-green">&lt;b&gt;</span> element.</b><br>

		<!-- <base> -->
		<span>The &lt;base&gt; element specifies a default URL and a default target (the "way" the link will open) for all links on a page. It is placed within the &lt;head&gt; element. It's like setting a custom home directory: <code>~/</code>, an absolute address serving as a reference (absolute) to all other links on a page (relative).</span>
		
		<!-- <bdi>, <bdo>, arabic, hebrew -->
			<span class="txt">For languages that are written right-to-left, e.g. Hebrew or Arabic, HTML's got us covered with &lt;bdi&gt; (Bi-Directional Isolation) and &lt;bdo&gt; (Bi-Directional Override). The former will format Arabic or Hebrew text (that is written right-to-left) to comply with the other, left-to-right languages, so that HTML does not render it all broken and stuff. And <i>vice versa</i> too, maybe there's an Arabic article containing the name <code>John Doe</code>, which is English, which is written left-to-right. As a result, so as not to experience undefined behaviour, we would wrap <code>John Doe</code> in &lt;bdi&gt; tags. It would then show up very nicely on the page. (Author's note: I've read somewhere japanese newspapers are read top-to-bottom.)</span>
		<input type="checkbox">TODO: Place examples.

		<!-- <bdo> -->
			<p>This is left-to-right text, wrapped in &lt;p&gt;tags.</p>
		<p><bdo dir="rtl">&lt;bdo dir="rtl"&gt;This is right-to-left text, also wrapped in &lt;p&gt; tags.&lt;/bdo&gt;</bdo></p>

		<blockquote>I really enjoy cooking delicious food. <q><cite>the big truths</cite>, gerald-phs</q></blockquote>
		
		<!-- <body> -->
			<span class="txt">This whole thing we're looking at are the contents of a &lt;body&gt; element. Here's a brief illustration of an HTML document:</span>
		<!-- <pre> contents -->		
			<pre class="markUp">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;

  &lt;head&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
					
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Local Developer Bakes Cake and Invites Neighbors to Eat Together&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;They all broke bread together, talked nonsense and had a merry time. The cake tasted delicious.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;

&lt;/html&gt;</pre><br>

		<!-- <br> -->
		<p>A line break can be added in HTML, too. Just like if we'd pressed <span class="buttonRtrn">Return ‚Ü©</span> on our keyboards, by using the <span class="code-green">&lt;br&gt;</span> element. It does not need a closing tag (it is a void element.)</p>

		<!-- <button> is related to <form> and there are a lot of attributes to cover. Let's just list the two most interesting ones. We'll come back to do forms later. -->
		<p>What follows is the <span class="code-green">&lt;button&gt;</span> element. Its content is the following text: <code>noodles</code>. Let's see if it works.</span> <button type="button">noodles</button></p>
		
		<!-- <canvas> -->
		<span class="txt">The &lt;canvas&gt; element defines an area on the page so that we can draw all sorts of stuff on it by writing JavaScript. <del>This is out of the scope of this manual.</del> (Update: I have actually understood, albeit superficially, what the code that generated that small yellow rectangle within the bigger, prettier rectangle below does! Although uglier, the former was way harder to generate than the latter.) Still, this is <code>theBigHTML</code>. No JS.) Contents within <span class="code-green">&lt;canvas&gt;</span> are only shown if the browser accessing the page does not support it (as a fallback warning) <b>OR</b> if I add some CSS to it??? This is the HTML manual <em>thing</em>. We are scientists. Science demands <strong>TESTING!</strong> Anyway, here's <span class="code-green">&lt;canvas&gt;</span>:</span><br>

		<canvas id="myCanvas" width="300" height="150">
			Your browser does not support the canvas element.
		</canvas>
		<script>
			const canvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
			const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
			ctx.fillStyle = "gold";
			ctx.fillRect(100, 10, 150, 75);
			</script>

<!-- <caption> -->
	<span class="txt">The <span class="code-green">&lt;caption&gt;</span> element is used together with the "<span class="code-green">&lt;table&gt;</span>" element, nested within it, upon creation of a table, to provide a description (hence "caption") for the table in question. Here it is in action:</span><br>
	<span class="txt">No <span class="code-green">&lt;caption&gt;</span>.</span>

		<cite>This is the content of a <span class="code-green">&lt;cite&gt;</span> element. It is used to mark up the title of a creative work: a mural, a poem, a painting, a movie etc. It is italicized by HTML to emphasize the title. Also, in textbooks and scientific publications this convention is also followed, so it is natural that HTML would do so as well.</cite><br>
		
		<code>This is the content of a <span class="code-green">&lt;code&gt;</span> element. It is rendered using the browser's default monospace font, and it is for displaying computer code (let foo = 1;)</code><br>
		
		<!-- <col> and <colgroup> -->
			<span class="txt"><span class="code-green">&lt;col&gt;</span> and 
		<span class="code-green">&lt;colgroup&gt;</span> aren't "content containers", but instead serve the purpose of styling <span class="code-green">&lt;table&gt;</span> elements.

		<!-- <datalist> -->
			<span class="txt">The <span class="code-green">&lt;datalist&gt;</span> element is better understood in the context of collecting user input using HTML which I know how to do in the frontend, but I've never touched a server. Let's leave it at that.</span><br>

				<summary>This is the content of a <span class="code-green">&lt;summary&gt;</span> element. It is also the content of a <span class="code-green">&lt;details&gt;</span> element, for it is nested within <span class="code-green">&lt;detail&gt;</span> tags.</summary>
			This is the content of a <span class="code-green">&lt;details&gt;</span> element. However, under no circumstances, can it be the content of a <span class="code-green">&lt;summary&gt;</span> element, for its closing tag (<span class="code-green">&lt;/summary&gt;</span>) was already declared.

    <footer>This is the content of a <span class="code-green">&lt;footer&gt;</span> element.

    <header>This is the content of a <span class="code-green">&lt;header&gt;</span> element. Besides its semantic function (which is to inform us about the nature of its contents), it's also used for the upper section of a webpage e.g. the navigation bar.</header>
		
    <main>This is the content of a <span class="code-green">&lt;main&gt;</span> element. Besides its  semantic function (which is to inform us about the nature of its contents), it's also used to specify  the main section of the webpage i.e. the ‚Äúmeat of the matter‚Äù itself. I don't know what will be the  correct situation: nesting sections and articles within main or nesting main within sections and   articles, but I bet the latter is wrong and probably considered bad practice.</main>

		<span class="txt">What follows is the content of a <span class="code-green">&lt;meter&gt;</span> element. It won't show up (as text, at least) but the ‚Äúprogress bar‚Äù it's supposed to render shows up alright:</span>
