		<h3>Initial Considerations</h3>
		<p>Lexicographers have to keep updating the dictionary to accomodate new slang, subcultural idioms, and different expressions, in order to maintain a categorical and trustworthy order, like a building, lest it falls apart due to its axiomatic structures being under duress. Otherwise, "Official Communication Letter to The United States Coast Guard" and "Fried Bananas Are Crazy My Name's Philip" may start to mean the same thing. In mathematics, there are axioms. In philosophy, there are axioms. In programming, there are also axioms. Therefore, in HTML, the <em>language of the web</em>, it should be no different. Rules, specifications, and standards exist. We should not be scared, but rather stand in awe of the marvelous abstract structural monument that was built, is being fixed daily, and is trusted by millions to keep working indefinitely (uptime-wise and future-wise). And it is freely available for our consultation. Therefore, if we are to call ourselves HTML professionals, there is categorically no other option than to peruse the sacred tomes...</p> 
		<p>Below, you will find brief descriptions of these remarkable institutions that I have collected from around the Web.</p>

		<!-- comment -->
		<span class="comment-green">&lt;!-- This is a comment. We know what a comment is. It documents code, but affects it not. --&gt;</span>
		
		<!-- doctype declaration -->
		<span>The <span class="code-green">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span> declaration. It has to be present on the very start of all HTML documents. No questions asked. This isn't the content of a <span class="code-green">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span> element <i>per se</i>, however, come to think of it, <b>this entire page could be considered the contents of that one single element (or perhaps <span class="code-green">&lt;html&gt;</span>)</b>. These words themselves are contents of a <span class="code-green">&lt;span&gt;</span> element.</span>
		
		<!-- <a>  -->
		<span>The <span class="code-green">&lt;a&gt;</span> element is for placing links in a page, and it stands for <span class="orange-shadow">anchor</span>. It has all sorts of different attributes and interesting features. I am not wrapping all this content in <span class="code-green">&lt;a&gt;</span> tags, for it would look very silly. Here's what it looks like <a href="https://www.google.com">by default</a>.</span>

		<!-- <abbr> -->
		<p>The acronym in the next sentence is wrapped in <span class="code-green">&lt;abbr&gt;</span> tags: The National Health Service (<abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>), is the publicly funded healthcare system in England...</p>

		<!-- <area> -->
		<span>The <span class="code-green">&lt;area&gt;</span> element. Image maps and clickable areas.</span>
		
		<article>This is the content of an <span class="code-green">&lt;article&gt;</span> element. Besides its semantic function (which is to inform us about the nature of its contents), it's also used to represent a section in a webpage that stands on its own two feet, and, in my own words, could be safely extracted from the webpage and the latter would not lose its essential conveyance meaning.</article>
		
		<aside>This is the content of an <span class="code-green">&lt;aside&gt;</span> element.</aside>
		
		<aside>This is the content of an <span class="code-green">&lt;aside&gt;</span> element. Besides its semantic function (which is to inform us about the nature of its contents), it's also used to represent a section in a webpage that stands aside from the document's main content, like a sidebar for example.</aside>

		<!-- <b> -->
		<b>This is the content of a <span class="code-green">&lt;b&gt;</span> element.</b><br>

		<!-- <base> -->
		<span>The &lt;base&gt; element specifies a default URL and a default target (the "way" the link will open) for all links on a page. It is placed within the &lt;head&gt; element. It's like setting a custom home directory: <code>~/</code>, an absolute address serving as a reference (absolute) to all other links on a page (relative).</span>

		<!-- <bdi>, <bdo>, arabic, hebrew -->
		<span class="txt">For languages that are written right-to-left, e.g. Hebrew or Arabic, HTML's got us covered with &lt;bdi&gt; (Bi-Directional Isolation) and &lt;bdo&gt; (Bi-Directional Override). The former will format Arabic or Hebrew text (that is written right-to-left) to comply with the other, left-to-right languages, so that HTML does not render it all broken and stuff. And <i>vice versa</i> too, maybe there's an Arabic article containing the name <code>John Doe</code>, which is English, which is written left-to-right. As a result, so as not to experience undefined behaviour, we would wrap <code>John Doe</code> in &lt;bdi&gt; tags. It would then show up very nicely on the page. (Author's note: I've read somewhere japanese newspapers are read top-to-bottom.)</span>

		<p><bdo dir="rtl">&lt;bdo dir="rtl"&gt;This is right-to-left text, also wrapped in &lt;p&gt; tags.&lt;/bdo&gt;</bdo></p>

		<!-- <body> -->
		<span class="txt">This whole thing we're looking at are the contents of a &lt;body&gt; element. Here's a brief illustration of an HTML document:</span>
		<div class="htmlDia">
			<pre>
				&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
				&lt;html&gt;
					&lt;head&gt;
					&lt;/head&gt;

					&lt;body&gt;
						&lt;h1&gt;Local Developer Bakes Cake and Invites Neighbors to Eat Together&lt;/h1&gt;
							&lt;p&gt;They all broke bread together, talked nonsense and had a merry time. The cake tasted delicious.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/body&gt;
				&lt;/html&gt;
			</pre>
			</div>

		<!-- <br> -->
		<span class="txt">A line break can be added in HTML, too, just like if we'd pressed <span class="buttonRtrn">Return ‚Ü©</span> on our keyboards, by using the <span class="code-green">&lt;br&gt;</span> element. It does not need a closing tag (it is a void element.)</span class="txt">

		<!-- <button> is related to <form> and there are a lot of attributes to cover. Let's just list the two most interesting ones. We'll come back to do forms later. -->
		<span class="txt">What follows is the <span class="code-green">&lt;button&gt;</span> element. Its content is the following text: <code>noodles</code>. Let's see if it works.</span> <button type="button">noodles</button>
		
		<!-- <canvas> -->
		<span class="txt">The &lt;canvas&gt; element defines an area on the page so that we can draw all sorts of stuff on it by writing JavaScript. <del>This is out of the scope of this manual.</del> (Update: I have actually understood, albeit superficially, what the code that generated that small yellow rectangle within the bigger, prettier rectangle below does! Although uglier, the former was way harder to generate than the latter.) Still, this is <code>theBigHTML</code>. No JS.) Contents within <span class="code-green">&lt;canvas&gt;</span> are only shown if the browser accessing the page does not support it (as a fallback warning) <b>OR</b> if I add some CSS to it??? This is the HTML manual <em>thing</em>. We are scientists. Science demands <strong>TESTING!</strong> Anyway, here's <span class="code-green">&lt;canvas&gt;</span>:</span><br>

		<canvas id="myCanvas" width="300" height="150">
			Your browser does not support the canvas element.
		</canvas>
		<script>
			const canvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
			const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
			ctx.fillStyle = "gold";
			ctx.fillRect(100, 10, 150, 75);

		</details>

		<!-- <dialog> involves JS -->
			<span class="code-red">&lt;dialog&gt;</span>This would be the content of a <span class="code-red">&lt;dialog&gt;</span> element, if it were pure HTML.<span class="code-red">&lt;/dialog&gt;</span>

    <div>This is the content of a <span class="code-green">&lt;div&gt;</span> element.</div>

    <em>This is the content of an <span class="code-green">&lt;em&gt;</span> element.</em>

    <footer>This is the content of a <span class="code-green">&lt;footer&gt;</span> element. Besides its semantic function (which is to inform us about the nature of its contents), it's also used for the lower section of a webpage e.g. contact information, the page author's name and so on.</footer>

    <header>This is the content of a <span class="code-green">&lt;header&gt;</span> element. Besides its semantic function (which is to inform us about the nature of its contents), it's also used for the upper section of a webpage e.g. the navigation bar.</header>

    <main>This is the content of a <span class="code-green">&lt;main&gt;</span> element. Besides its  semantic function (which is to inform us about the nature of its contents), it's also used to specify  the main section of the webpage i.e. the ‚Äúmeat of the matter‚Äù itself. I don't know what will be the  correct situation: nesting sections and articles within main or nesting main within sections and   articles, but I bet the latter is wrong and probably considered bad practice.</main>

		<span class="txt">What follows is the content of a <span class="code-green">&lt;meter&gt;</span> element. It won't show up (as text, at least) but the ‚Äúprogress bar‚Äù it's supposed to render shows up alright:</span> 
		<meter value="75" min="0" max="100">Something is happening</meter>
		<span class="txt">As with <span class="code-green">&lt;a&gt;</span> and others, this is a very interesting element with some features. I will come back to this later to document it further.</span>
   
		<pre>This is the content of a <span class="code-green">&lt;pre&gt;</span> element.</pre><br>
		
    <section>This is the content of a <span class="code-green">&lt;section&gt;</span> element.</section>

    <small>This is the content of a <span class="code-green">&lt;small&gt;</span> element.</small><br>

    <span>This is the content of a <span class="code-green">&lt;span&gt;</span> element. (Note: no <span class="code-green">&lt;br&gt;</span> was added: <span class="code-green">&lt;div&gt;</span> is a block-level element).</span>

    <strong>This is the content of a <span class="code-green">&lt;strong&gt;</span> element.</strong><br>
