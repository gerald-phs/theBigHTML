  <p>This is a paragraph. The Capital City of <span>${city}</span> has been struck by a massive earthquake, 10 degrees on the Richter scale. Well that's no good. People are desperate and without their homes. <span>${city}</span>‚Äôs Government is hard at work to repare the damage caused.</p>
  <code>The paragraph is a block-level element, meaning that it creates a rectangular block on the page that takes up the <b>full width of its parent container and creates a new line before and after the element (just like when we do</b></code><span class="codeAlt">&lt;br&gt;</span><code><b>.)</b></code>
  <br>
  <code>A <span class="codeAlt">&lt;br&gt;</span> was added above. Below we will see <span class="codeAlt">&lt;hr&gt;</span>. The former refers to a <span class="orange-shadow">line break</span>, a <i>new line</i> literally, the result of pressing enter/return key, a ‚Äúnewline‚Äù character (<span class="orange-shadow">\n</span>) etc, all that jazz. The latter renders a <i><span class="orange-shadow">horizontal line</span></i>, a divider, representing a thematic change in content.</code>

  <header>This is the content of a <span class="codeAlt">&lt;header&gt;</span> element. Besides its semantic function (which is to inform us about the nature of its contents), it's also used for the upper section of a webpage e.g. the navigation bar.</header>

  <br>
  <footer>This is the content of a <span class="codeAlt">&lt;footer&gt;</span> element. Besides its semantic function (which is to inform us about the nature of its contents), it's also used for the lower section of a webpage e.g. contact information, the page author's name and so on.</footer>

  <code>A line break is added.</code>
  <br>
  <main>This is the content of a <span class="codeAlt">&lt;main&gt;</span> element. Besides its semantic function (which is to inform us about the nature of its contents), it's also used to specify the main section of the webpage i.e. the ‚Äúmeat of the matter‚Äù itself. I don't know what will be the correct situation: nesting sections and articles within main or nesting main within sections and articles, but I bet the latter is wrong and probably considered bad practice.</main>

  <span>The <span class="codeAlt">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span> declaration. It has to be present on the very start of all HTML documents. No questions asked.</span></span>

  <span>The <span class="codeAlt">&lt;a&gt;</span> element is for placing links in a page, and it stands for <span class="orange-shadow">anchor</span>. It has all sorts of different attributes and interesting features. Here's what it looks like <a href="https://www.google.com">by default</a>.</span>

  <p>The acronym in the next sentence is wrapped in <span class="codeAlt">&lt;abbr&gt;</span> tags: The National Health Service (<abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>), is the publicly funded healthcare system in England...</p>

  <article>This is the content of an <span class="codeAlt">&lt;article&gt;</span> element. Besides its semantic function (which is to inform us about the nature of its contents), it's also used to represent a section in a webpage that stands on its own two feet, and, in my own words, could be safely extracted from the webpage and the latter would not lose its essential conveyance meaning.</article>
  <br>
  <aside>This is the content of an <span class="codeAlt">&lt;aside&gt;</span> element. Besides its semantic function (which is to inform us about the nature of its contents), it's also used to represent a section in a webpage that stands aside from the document's main content, like a sidebar for example.</aside>
