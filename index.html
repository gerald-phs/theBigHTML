		<p class="typography">The spoken language is alive: and it comes up with all sorts of creative ways to resist entropy. It'll change and adapt. Therefore, lexicographers have to keep updating the dictionary to accomodate new slang, subcultural idioms, and different expressions, in order to maintain a solid abstract structure, like a building itself, lest it falls apart due to its axiomatic postulations being under duress. Otherwise:

        <span class="za">United States Coast Guard<br>
          13th of March, 1932<br>
          Purgatory Bay

        To whom it may concern, <br><br>
        We are Captain Barbossa and 30 souls (mostly sailors) onboard <i>USS Stormrider</i>. All seawater has turned <span class=xa>red</span> — as far as the eye can see.
        NS Rick Scallywag had his eyes on what appeared to be
        a demonic monster emerging from the depths, almost as if from Davy Jones' locker itself, its scales glistening in the moonlight amidst this blood-red vastness. No man in this vessel has ever seen the likes of such terror before. Silence is imposed on all frequencies.<br><br> Esteemed Governor, this is Captain Barbossa.<br><br>
        Please send a priest.

      </blockquote class="godBlockQuote"><br> May start to mean the same thing. In mathematics, there are axioms. In philosophy, there are axioms. In programming, there are also axioms. Therefore, in HTML, the <em>language of the web</em>, it should be no different. Rules, specifications, and standards exist. We should not be scared, but rather stand in awe of the marvelous abstract structural monument that was built, is being fixed daily, and is trusted by millions to keep working indefinitely (uptime-wise and future-wise). And it is freely available for our consultation. Therefore, if we are to call ourselves HTML professionals, I see no way forward than to peruse the sacred tomes...</p>
