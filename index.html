  <span class="narrator">What follows is a paragraph:</span> <p class="paragraph-one">The Capital City of Nowhere has been struck by a massive earthquake, 10 degrees on the Richter scale. Well that's no good. People are desperate and without their homes. Nowhere‚Äôs Government is hard at work to repare the damage caused, and the people are working to clean up.</p>

  <span class="narrator">It looks like <span class="codeAlt">&lt;p&gt;</span> is a block-level element, meaning that it creates a rectangular block on the page that takes up the <b>full width</b> of its <span class="gradient">parent container</span> and causes a <span class="orange-shadow">line break</span> before and after itself (just like when we do <span class="codeAlt">&lt;br&gt;</span>)<a href="#newline"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
  <br><br>
  Okay, below we will see <span class="codeAlt">&lt;hr&gt;</span>. It renders a <span class="orange-shadow">horizontal line</span>: a divider, representing a thematic change in content.</span class="narrator">

  <main>This is the content of a <span class="codeAlt">&lt;main&gt;</span> element. Besides its semantic function (which is to inform us about the nature of its contents), it's also used to specify the main section of the webpage i.e. the ‚Äúmeat of the matter‚Äù itself. I don't know what will be the correct situation: nesting sections and articles within main or nesting main within sections and articles, but I bet the latter is wrong and probably considered bad practice.</main>

  <span>The <span class="codeAlt">&lt;a&gt;</span> element is for placing links in a page, and it stands for <span class="orange-shadow">anchor</span>. It has all sorts of different attributes and interesting features. Here's what it looks like <a href="https://www.google.com">by default</a>.</span>

  <article>This is the content of an <span class="codeAlt">&lt;article&gt;</span> element. Besides its semantic function (which is to inform us about the nature of its contents), it's also used to represent a section in a webpage that stands on its own two feet, and, in my own words, could be safely extracted from the webpage and the latter would not lose its essential conveyance meaning.</article>
  <br>
  <aside>This is the content of an <span class="codeAlt">&lt;aside&gt;</span> element. Besides its semantic function (which is to inform us about the nature of its contents), it's also used to represent a section in a webpage that stands aside from the document's main content, like a sidebar for example.</aside>
